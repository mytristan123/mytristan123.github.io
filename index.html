	<h3>1. Hobbies</h3>
	<p id="paragraph_blue">I never find enough time to do everything I want, but I particularly like going to the cinema, the theater, a concert, visiting an exhibition or a monument, strolling without a goal necessarily precise.</p>
	
	<h3>2. Movies</h3>
	<p id="paragraph_blue">I love watching movies, and most of my favorite movies are action movies or thrillers. Amongst this, my favorite directors are Steven Spielberg, I have seen almost all his films.</p>
	
	<h3>3. Cars</h3>
	<p id="paragraph_purple">This passion has been passed on to me by my father since my early childhood. Indeed, professional mechanic, my father has always had beautiful cars. Since small, I already aspired to drive. Today, I love to go rallying to watch beautiful cars and see car races.</p>
	
	<h3>4. Videos games</h3>
	<p id="paragraph_purple">This is for me one of the best distractions that can exist. I feel really good when I play, it's a way to let off steam. My favorites are FPS games and Sports games like Call of Duty or FIFA.</p>
	
	<h3>5. Sport</h3>
	<p id="paragraph_purple">I have always loved the sport even if for some time, I really feel the need. I like sport for many different things, the sport allows you to clear your head, to think about nothing, to spend, to evacuate his bad mood ... When I play sports I feel well in tune with myself and I love it. I love to feel the effort it takes and the pleasure when you succeed. I love sport because it's a learning experience, sometimes you lose, sometimes you win, but you always learn about your losses and that's what I like.</p>
